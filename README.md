# Go / Gin API Starter

## Why? It's Christmas and I'm bored!

I needed to fill the time and couldn't think of a good project, this is just a little starter 
to help the next project on its feet a little quicker.
<br><br>
The idea of this was to lay the groundwork for an API that should be well organized and easily expandable.
<br>
Specific things of note would be:
- using gin web framework
- support for .env file
- api versioning (not yet)
- organized file structure
- postgres hookup (not yet)
- UUID hookup (not yet)
